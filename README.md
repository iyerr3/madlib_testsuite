TINC testsuite for MADlib
==============================

TINC is a test framework developed in EMC Greenplum aiming at providing an 
easy to use and extensible testing framework for all kinds of tests done in
Greenplum. It is a cross-team effort to revamp the entire GPDB test 
infrastructure.

By writing a subclass in the TINC, we developed a testing framework suitable
for MADlib testing.
